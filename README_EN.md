# LLM Configuration
OLLAMA_MODEL=phi3
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your-hf-api-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini  # or your chosen model

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

## Running with Async Worker

To enable background question generation processing:

```powershell
$env:ENABLE_GERACOES_WORKER="1"; python app.py
```

The worker will automatically process pending generation jobs in the background without blocking the web interface.
